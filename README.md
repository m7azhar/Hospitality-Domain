# How Data Analysts Build Dashboard in Real Time? | Revenue Insights | Hospitality Domain 

## Problem Statement

Your task is to develop a dashboard that generates revenue insights for At Lake Grants, a hotel chain facing competition from rivals. The dashboard should provide valuable insights for management decision-making.

## Data Set

The project utilizes a dataset that mimics real-world hotel industry data. The dataset includes:

- Hotels file: Contains information on hotel locations, property names, and types
- Room types file: Details room types and their specifications
- Booking data file: Records booking-related information
- Aggregated bookings file: Provides aggregated booking data
- Metric list file: Defines formulas for various business concepts

## Dashboard Mockup

The dashboard mockup outlines the visuals, KPIs, weekly trends, and other elements to be included in the final dashboard. You can use the provided dataset to create this dashboard.

## Discussion with Domain Expert

Abhishek Anand, a revenue manager at Oyo Rooms, reviewed the dashboard mockup and suggested incorporating the following metrics:

- **Ref Path (Revenue per Available Room)**: Calculated by dividing total revenue by total rooms available to sell
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Represents the average rate sold per room

He also explained the relationship between Ref Path and ADR, emphasizing ADR as the ideal state. When occupancy is 100%, Ref Path and ADR are equal. Available rooms play a crucial role in occupancy calculations.

Additionally, Abhishek highlighted the importance of sellable room nights (SRN) and daily sellable room nights (DSRN) in the hotel industry:

- **Sellable Room Nights (SRN)**: Calculated by dividing total revenue generated by the number of rooms sold by the total number of available rooms. This metric helps identify room blocking and maintenance issues.
- **Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)**: Calculated on a daily basis by dividing SRN by the number of days in a month.

## Dashboard Development

The dashboard development process involves:

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis:** Analyze the prepared data to extract meaningful insights.
3. **Dashboard Design:** Create a visually appealing and informative dashboard using Power BI.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand the business problem and data set thoroughly before embarking on dashboard development.
- Consult a domain expert for valuable feedback and suggestions.
- Prioritize simplicity and focus on key metrics when designing the dashboard.
- Utilize filters to track different business segments and gain deeper insights.
- Regularly monitor trends to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement.

## Conclusion

Building real-time dashboards using Power BI empowers data analysts to provide valuable revenue insights for hospitality businesses. By understanding the business context, leveraging domain expertise, and employing effective data analysis techniques, you can create impactful dashboards that drive informed decision-making.
